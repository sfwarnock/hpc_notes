    "Katrina Advisory Exercise\n",
    "=========================\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever there's a Hurricane spinning out in the Atlantic (or Pacific), the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ([NOAA](http://www.noaa.gov/)) issues advisories about the storm's strength.  In this example, we will look at one such advisory for the infamous [Hurricane Katrina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Katrina) that did so much damage to New Orleans in 2005.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you would like to build an application that \"reads\" storm advisories and assigns a danger level without human interaction. There are a lot of tools that could help with this (like [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/)) with fancy algorithms, but we're going to take a very simple approach of scanning the document for relevant words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike a few of the other string exercises, the text for this example is located in a file on disk.  We haven't gotten to reading and writing files yet, but that is OK.  The following snippet of code opens the file \"katrina_advisory.txt\" (which is located in the same directory as this exercise), and dumps its contents into a string called `text`.  From here on out, you can work with `text` just as if you created the string yourself."
